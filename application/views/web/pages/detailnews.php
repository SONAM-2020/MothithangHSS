                    💁‍♂️Today we have successfully conducted 2nd round of Student's Representative Council meeting for all level of classes with class captains as class representatives. Today's meeting was chaired by our newly elected SRC presidents and School captains.
                    All captains🙎👦👩👦 are members of SRC (the Student's Representative Council), which comprises of entirely student bodies (besides the focal teacher as a mediator). They often come to such meeting with suggestions or feedbacks and even complaints (collected from individual class members) for the over all development as well as for the greater good of school at large. Few minor issues are discussed, negotiated and solved within the meeting by focal teacher along with SRC presidents and school captains in presence of all class representatives.
                </p>

                    SRC presidents and school captains take a lead role to ✍collect, refine, filter and forward series of issues discussed thoroughly, often with heated debate too🖎📩 to school authority for immediate action.
                    Such meetings have far reaching effect for better functioning of our school as only wearer knows where shoe pinches. This is because the voice 👄of every student will be heard 👂from it, and measures will be taken as par the need, necessity and importance for students by our management.
